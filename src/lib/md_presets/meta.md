# Hello from victorr.me

This is my website - my **personal and virtual portfolio** website, to be exact.

<br>

## What you can find on victorr.me:
- My contact info
- Projects and showcases
- Articles
- Fun tools and gizmos

This website has been a side project I've worked on in my free time for over a month now.  
Right now it's a bit bare, but I'll fill it out with future works.
<br>

I've had **sooo much fun** building this â€” new expansions with more tools and things to do are coming **for sure**.

<br>

## Technical side
The website is made with Svelte 5, Tailwind, Interact.js, and Three.js.  
If you're curious to see the code, you can check it out in [*my GitHub repo*](https://github.com/VictorOrrios/victorr.me).  
And if you want to [*ask me something*](mailto:victorr.orrios.b@gmail.com) about it, I'll be more than happy to reply!
