# About

- *Who are you? What do you do?*  
-
I'm Víctor Orrios Barón, the owner of this website! I'm currently in my last year of Computer Engineering, and I enjoy working on personal projects like this website.

- *Why do you study Computer Engineering?*  
-
I always knew I was going to choose a STEM career. Originally, I studied two years of Electronic and Automatic Engineering before realizing that my true passion was coding.

- *What projects do you enjoy doing the most?*  
-
Right now, I'm really into computer graphics. This summer I built a ray tracer, and it's probably one of my favorite things I've ever done.

- *How did you start learning programming and graphics?*  
-
I started coding at 13 years old with YouTube C++ calculator tutorials. For graphics, I used this [**book**](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and this [**website**](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) as my starting point. I like learning on my own because that’s when I’m the most efficient.

- *What do you like to do outside of coding?*  
-
Coding **is** my hobby - I’m just lucky that it can also be a job. I also enjoy going to the gym and listening to [**music**](https://open.spotify.com/user/khx8kykl04x58bfyycgt5qigi?si=df8ee00e2c604461) (cheeky spotify plug).

- *Where do you see yourself in 10 years?*  
-
Maybe in another city or country, doing something graphics related, perhaps in the videogame industry or as a team leader in a research group.

- *Are you working on something interesting right now?*  
-
Yes! As part of our Computer Graphics course, a friend and I are building a WebGL ray tracer that’s bigger and better than the one I made this summer. When we finish it, I’ll put it up here so you can try it in real time!
